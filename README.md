# Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization
##  Project Overview
The **Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization** project is designed to analyze sales patterns and enhance performance in retail stores.  

In todayâ€™s competitive market, it is essential to understand **why some stores perform better than others**. This project leverages sales data, economic indicators, and store characteristics to generate insights that can guide businesses in making data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets Used
1. **Sales Data** â†’ Weekly sales for all stores and departments.  
2. **Features Data** â†’ Includes economic/environmental factors like weather, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.  
3. **Stores Data** â†’ Information about store type and size.  

All datasets were **merged on common keys** (`Store`, `Date`, `IsHoliday`) to create a unified dataset for analysis.

##  Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Merged all datasets.  
- Handled missing values.  
- Standardized date formats.  
- Created new time-based features (`Month`, `Week`, `Year`).  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Studied sales trends across time, holidays, and store types.  
- Visualized patterns (holiday peaks, seasonal cycles, store size impact).  
- **Key observations**:
  - Sales peak during holidays.  
  - Larger stores generally outperform smaller ones.  
  - Store Type A consistently shows stronger performance.  

### 3. Modeling
- **Regression Models** â†’ Predict weekly sales.  
- **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)** â†’ Group stores with similar performance patterns.  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data cleaning, analysis, and modeling  
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration  

---

##  Key Insights
- Holiday weeks significantly boost sales.  
- Store Type A performs better on average compared to Types B & C.  
- Larger stores consistently show higher weekly sales.  
- Economic factors (fuel price, CPI, unemployment) also influence sales patterns.  

---

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze historical retail data to discover sales patterns.  
- Identify features influencing store performance.  
- Build predictive and clustering models for optimization.  
- Summarize findings through interactive notebooks and presentations.  

---

##  Current Status
-  Data cleaning, integration, and exploratory analysis completed.  
-  Regression and clustering models tested.  
-  Findings summarized in a presentation.  
-  Future scope: advanced modeling (time-series forecasting, deep learning).
